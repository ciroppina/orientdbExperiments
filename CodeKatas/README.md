*** Code Kata 18 - transitive dependencies ***

 This is my Java implementation of the famous Kata 18: 
 (http://codekata.com/kata/kata18-transitive-dependencies/)
 
 There are two implementations:
 - one using java.util.Map (Dependencies)

 Both are performing very fast, the seconds has more code. 
 Metrics are comparable
